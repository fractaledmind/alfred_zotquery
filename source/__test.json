In these passages Aristotle is making a literary reference : the geometer at work with the \u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03af\u03b1 is Theodorus, engaged in a series of proofs about incommensurable lines at Plato, Tht. 147 D.",

It wrestles with the problem of how to define and assimilate satire and justifies the poet's own position in a suspicious society. The commentary gives full weight to the dense texture of these poems while helping readers interpret their most cryptic aspects and appreciate their technical finesse. The introduction puts Horace in context as late-Republican newcomer and a vital figure in the development of satire and discusses the structure and meaning of Satires I, literary and philosophical influences, style, metre, transmission and Horace's rich afterlife. Each poem is followed by an essay offering overall interpretation. This work is designed for upper-level students and scholars of classics but contains much of interest to specialists in later European literature.",
